# NodeJS Supermarket Inventory Application 

## Overview

--INCOMPLETE PROJECT--

A supermarket inventory application that supports all of the CRUD methods, so that
the user can create, read, update or delete any item, customer, etc.  The items
can support myriad fields such as item name, department, description, price per 
unit, price per pound, etc.  The same goes for each customer and item instance 
(eg. stock).

## My process

### Built with

- Node.js
- Express app made with express-generator
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- EJS


### What I learned

- I initiated this project after completing my first-ever Express application 
(following along with a tutorial), so this was my first *original* Express app.
- I took the time to sketch out the models and their fields on paper.  I had
learned that due to the complexity of these applications that it is important to 
do so before coding.
